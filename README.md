# Priority-Based Ticket Booking System with VIP Access

## Objective:
To create a ticket booking system that prioritizes certain users, designated as "VIPs," by allowing them to bypass the standard booking queue and gain immediate access to ticket booking, enhancing their user experience while maintaining an efficient queuing system for all users.

## Project Description:
This project involves developing a ticket booking system that uses a priority-based queuing mechanism to offer preferential treatment to VIP users. The system will consist of a regular queue for standard users and a priority queue for VIP users. When booking opens, VIP users will have immediate access, even if they join later than regular users. The project will explore the implementation of these data structures, analyze their performance and evaluate the impact of priority handling on user wait times and overall system efficiency.
